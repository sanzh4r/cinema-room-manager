This is a hyperskill.org project of Cinema Room Manager built in Kotlin. It is called to function as a simple
cinema room manager, where you can overview seats, book seats and also see the statistics over the sold seats.

Some additional features, apart from the ones specified in the project documentation, were added.
For example, better management of sold seats was added:

* not possible to book the same seat two times;
* the program warns you when there are no seats available;
* NumberFormatException is introduced for user input to handle exceptions and to hinder program from crashing.

Finished and  uploaded by Sanzhar A. in August 2023.
